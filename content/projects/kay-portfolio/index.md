With a focus on optimizing the loading process and showcasing the client’s work, I built this design portfolio using Vue. I used low-resolution image placeholders and lazy loading to ensure a smooth and efficient loading process and enable the use of high-quality images.

The project also features modal routing, which allows users to quickly view the designs without navigating away from the main portfolio page. The end result is a seamless and user-friendly design portfolio that effectively features the client’s work and skills.
