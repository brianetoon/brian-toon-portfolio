I created a graphic design portfolio where showcasing high-resolution images was a priority. To accomplish this, I used low-resolution image placeholders and lazy loading. This enabled a smooth loading process and user experience while still rendering high-quality images of the client's work. This project also features modal routing which allows users to quickly and easily view the design showcase without navigating away from the main page.
