I partnered with another developer on this project to turn a Figma design into a responsive and functioning website. I focused on the home page, routing and laying the groundwork for the styles. I also created animations using GSAP for an improved user experience. The finished product effectively presented the clientâ€™s work and helped them land a new job, while I gained valuable experience working on a small team and using version control on a shared GitHub repository.
