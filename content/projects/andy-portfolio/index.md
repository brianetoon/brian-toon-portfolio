I developed a dynamic and visually appealing portfolio website using Vue and GSAP. By incorporating sleek animations, I was able to enhance the user experience and bring the clientâ€™s portfolio to life. I collaborated with another developer on Github, where I gained experience in version control and working with a shared repository.
