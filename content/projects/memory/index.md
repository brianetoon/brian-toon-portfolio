The goal of this project was to demonstrate understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. This was an assignment for a class and I was allowed to create any application of my choosing as long as it utilized DOM properites, methods and event driven programming. To meet these requirements, I decided to create a space themed memory game utilizing DOM based event delegation and class manipulation to "flip" cards in response to user interaction.
