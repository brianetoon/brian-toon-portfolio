The purpose of this project was to practice building a simple website using just HTML and CSS for a class. The subject matter for the website could be anything of our choosing. I decided to create the website for the Rex Kwon Do Martial Arts Academy, after the character Rex from the movie Napoleon Dynamite. Despite being limited to just HTML and CSS, I had fun creating it and was really happy with how it came out.
