I built a design portfolio using Vue, with a focus on optimizing the loading process and showcasing the client's work in the best possible way. To achieve this, I used low-quality image placeholders and lazy loading to ensure a smooth and efficient loading process and enable the use of high-quality images to showcase the client's work. The project also features modal routing, which allows users to quickly and easily view the client's work without navigating away from the main portfolio page. The end result is a seamless and user-friendly design portfolio that effectively showcases the client's work and skills.
