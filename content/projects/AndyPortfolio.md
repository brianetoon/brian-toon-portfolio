I developed a dynamic and visually appealing portfolio website for a client using Vue and GSAP. By incorporating sleek animations, I was able to enhance the user experience and bring the client's portfolio to life. Additionally, I collaborated with another developer on Github, which allowed me to gain valuable experience in working with others and further honed my knowledge of version control of a shared repository.
