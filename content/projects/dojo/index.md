I found an awesome but outdated tutorial that uses older versions of React and Firebase to create a project planner application. I took it as a challenge to bring it up to date using the latest versions of React and Firebase. The React front-end uses custom hooks to authenticate users and allows them to create, read, update and delete the data when logged in. In the process, I learned how to use the current version of React with the new Firebase API. I also added a number of brand new features to the project including read-only guest access, improved project filtering and a more responsive user interface.
