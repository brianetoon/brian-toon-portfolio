Using React and Firebase, I adapted and improved a project planner web application. Originally based on an outdated tutorial, the new app features a Firestore database and user authentication, with back-end rules controlling data access. To enhance the app’s performance and simplify the code, I leveraged custom React hooks to handle complex logic and state management. This included Firestore data requests and user authentication. 

As a fun challenge, I used newer versions of React and Firebase libraries and added new features like project filtering, read-only guest access, and a more responsive design. This enhanced the app’s ease of use and functionality.
